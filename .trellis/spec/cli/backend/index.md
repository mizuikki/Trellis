## Pre-Development Checklist

Before writing backend code, read the relevant guidelines based on your task:

- Error handling → [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md)
- Logging → [logging-guidelines.md](./logging-guidelines.md)
- Adding a platform → [platform-integration.md](./platform-integration.md)
- Modifying `init.ts` flow (new triggers, dispatch branches, bootstrap/joiner) → [platform-integration.md "Bootstrap & Joiner Task Auto-Generation"](./platform-integration.md) — two-point wiring + `.developer` signal
- Script work → [script-conventions.md](./script-conventions.md)
- Migration system → [migrations.md](./migrations.md)
- Writing/deleting/moving/overwriting files in a user repo (any `writeFileSync`, `rmSync`, `renameSync`, `shutil.move`, or user/agent-supplied path segment) → [filesystem-safety.md](./filesystem-safety.md)
- Cutting a release / manifest continuity / npm publishing → [release-process.md](./release-process.md)
- Editing `packages/core/**`, moving reusable CLI logic into core, or changing CLI imports from `@mindfoldhq/trellis-core` → [trellis-core-sdk.md](./trellis-core-sdk.md)
- Adding any native (`.node` / C++ / `node-gyp`) dependency → [quality-guidelines.md "Native dependency policy"](./quality-guidelines.md)
- Editing `[workflow-state:STATUS]` breadcrumb blocks / `task.json.status` writers / lifecycle hooks → [workflow-state-contract.md](./workflow-state-contract.md)
- Editing `configurators/shared.ts` (placeholder substitution, write helpers, prelude injection) → [configurator-shared.md](./configurator-shared.md)
- Editing `commands/mem.ts` (subcommands, platform indexers, search/cleaning pipeline) → [commands-mem.md](./commands-mem.md)
- Editing `commands/upgrade.ts` (global CLI self-upgrade behavior) → [commands-upgrade.md](./commands-upgrade.md)
- Editing `commands/update.ts` (flags, plan, apply phases, idempotency) → [commands-update.md](./commands-update.md) — manifest mechanics still in [migrations.md](./migrations.md)
- Editing `commands/workflow.ts`, `utils/workflow-resolver.ts`, workflow marketplace entries, or `init --workflow` behavior → [commands-workflow.md](./commands-workflow.md)
- Editing the `platforms` subcommand in `cli/index.ts` → [commands-platforms.md](./commands-platforms.md)
- Editing `commands/uninstall.ts` or `utils/uninstall-scrubbers.ts` → [commands-uninstall.md](./commands-uninstall.md) + [uninstall-scrubbers.md](./uninstall-scrubbers.md)
- Editing `commands/channel/**` (events.jsonl protocol, supervisors, adapters, project buckets, channel-lifecycle commands) → [commands-channel.md](./commands-channel.md)

Also read [unit-test/conventions.md](../unit-test/conventions.md) — specifically the "When to Write Tests" section.

## Quality Check

After writing code, verify against these guidelines:

1. Run `git diff --name-only` to see what you changed
2. Read the relevant guidelines above for each changed area
3. Always check [quality-guidelines.md](./quality-guidelines.md)
4. Check if tests need to be added or updated:
   - New pure function → needs unit test
   - Bug fix → needs regression test
   - Changed init/update behavior → needs integration test update
5. Run lint and typecheck:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
   ```

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
