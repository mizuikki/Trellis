# Continue Current Task

Resume work on the current task — pick up at the right phase/step in `.trellis/workflow.md`.

---

## Step 1: Load Current Context

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py
```

Confirms: current task, git state, recent commits.

## Step 2: Load the Phase Index

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase
```

Shows the Phase Index (Plan / Execute / Finish) with routing + skill mapping.

## Step 3: Decide Where You Are

`get_context.py` shows the active task's `status` field. Route by `status` + artifact presence. This command replaces the user needing to remember the Trellis flow; it does not itself approve implementation.

- `status=planning` + no `prd.md` → **1.1** (load `trellis-brainstorm`)
- `status=planning` + any present `design.md` / `implement.md` path is non-regular (including a symlink), unreadable, empty, or has `<!-- trellis:scaffold-unfilled -->` in its first five lines → **1.1**. It is artifact-pending, not complete; fill and review Core and triggered semantics before removing that artifact's sentinel.
- `status=planning` + lightweight task with `prd.md` complete → **1.4** review.
- `status=planning` + complex task missing either `design.md` or `implement.md` → **1.1** and run `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py scaffold <task> all`, then fill and review both artifacts.
- `status=planning` + complex artifacts machine-ready and authoring-reviewed + sub-agent jsonl not curated (only the seed `_example` row) → **1.3**
- `status=planning` + required artifacts machine-ready and authoring-reviewed + required jsonl curated or inline mode → **1.4** (ask for start review; only run `task.py start` after user confirms)
- `status=in_progress` + implementation not started → **2.1**
- `status=in_progress` + implementation done, not yet checked → **2.2**
- `status=in_progress` + check passed → **3.3** (spec update) → **3.4** (commit)
- `status=completed` (rare; usually archived immediately) → archive flow

Phase rules (full detail in `.trellis/workflow.md`):

1. Run steps **in order** within a phase — `[required]` steps must not be skipped
2. `[once]` steps are already done only when their output is ready, not merely present. `prd.md` alone can be enough only for lightweight tasks; complex tasks also need machine-ready, authoring-reviewed `design.md` and `implement.md`. Do not lint H2 names.
3. You may go back to an earlier phase if discoveries require it

## Step 4: Load the Specific Step

Once you know which step to resume at:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.X> --platform codex
```

Follow the loaded instructions. After each `[required]` step completes, move to the next.

## Reference

Full workflow and detailed phase steps live in `.trellis/workflow.md`. This command is only an entry point — the canonical guidance is there.
